Tableau to visualize bike-sharing data

### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

We use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for your analysis. We use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, we add these new visualizations to the two created in the module for final presentation and analysis.

### Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

> In this visualization, we graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

> In this visualization, we graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender which we can see it's the highest for Males.

> In this visualization, we graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap which is between 5-9 AM and 4-8 PM.

> In this visualization, we graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap which is the highest for Males.

> In this visualization, we create a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype which is the highest for Males Subscribers.

> In this visualization, we create a pie that shows the usertype which is the number of short-term customers and annual subscribers to the Citi Bike service. we can see many rides were recorded for Subscribers.

> In this visualization, we graph the peak hours for bike trips during the month of August, we see that between 6-10 AM and 4-8 PM is the peak hours and it's better to have the most bikes at that time.

> In this visualization, we graph the Bike Repairs to see Which bikes are most likely due for repair. The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance, the left side of the graph is for the bikes with the most rides.

> In this visualization, we graph the Bike Utilization, the bike ids with bigger circle shows longer tripduration and highest utilization.

### Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

- we can see the busiest times of the day and repair the bikes in the slowest times of day which is 1-5 AM.
- more than 30% of the bikes are in high use.
- Subscribers are the most usage specially Males gender which is better considering more bikes for subscribers.
- 6-10 AM and 5-7 PM are the busiest time of the day which is better considering more available bikes at that time.


I was thinking it would be better if we know the bikes with the most usage belongs to what type of user that way it would be easier to be prepared for repairs and maintenance. which in this visulization we can see bikes with the most usage belongs to Subsciber type.

> In this visualization, we graph the peak hours for bike trips by gender, which we can see what time of the day they ride the most by gender.
